## 🔗 KEY RELATIONSHIPS (What connects to what)

### Phase Dependencies
```
Phase 10 (Context) ← Foundation for everything
    ↓ Input from
Phase 11 (Input Processing)
    ↓ Feeds into
Phase 14 (Reasoning) & Phase 12 (Output)
    ↓ Measured by
Phase 13 (Analytics)
    ↓ Learning from
Phase 15 (Proactive Learning) → Improves Phase 11-14
```

### Strategic Phases
```

```

### ARQIO Integration
```
ARQIO = Phases 10-15 (foundation) + Phases 16-25 (specialization)

5 Information Blocks:
├─ Block 1: Regulations (Phase 11 parsing, Phase 14 reasoning)
├─ Block 2: Projects DB (Phase 15 learning)
├─ Block 3: Processes (Phase 14 reasoning)
├─ Block 4: Sensors (Phase 10 context)
└─ Block 5: Business Logic (Phase 12 output)
```

## 🔄 SYNCHRONIZATION RULES

### Avoid Duplication
- ✅ **Do**: Reference other files when concepts appear elsewhere
- ✅ **Do**: Use "See Phase X, section Y" format
- ❌ **Don't**: Repeat full explanations across files
- ❌ **Don't**: Create conflicting versions of concepts

### Cross-References Format
```
→ See PHASE_10_ACM_ARCHITECTURE.md for context management
→ For learning strategy, see PHASE_15_PL_ARCHITECTURE.md
→ Related: ARQIO_CONSTRUCTION_PM_PLATFORM.md (application example)
```

### Version Control
- All Phase (10-15) documents are STABLE
- Future roadmap (16-25) is STRATEGIC (may evolve)
- ARQIO document is DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (template for other domains)
